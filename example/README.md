<h1> A working example </h1>

This folder contains a full working example of reasonable size (10 medium sized genomes) for the user
to experiment with.

Run it using `./masterscript InputParams test`

This command will create a session folder named <b>test</b> and launch everything 
in a fully automated and thus transparent manner. After everything is finished
the user will be notified by an email. The expected time required varies
between 8 and 15 hours, depending on the Grid's load at the time of submitting.
The output will be made available in the <b>Phylo_output</b>  directories, 
each file contains the profiles for every sequence of the respective genome.
The user can check that those match perfectly the files inside the <b>PhyloOutputRef</b> directory. The procedure
will also return the intermediate results, namely the Blast output.


Results can be post processed to facilitate visualization using any of the
libraries provided in the postProcessing Java package. For example 
the user can try to run the `PhyloCollapse` or the `phyloFilter` processes to 
reduce the output.
